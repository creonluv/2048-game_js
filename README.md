# 2048 Game

In this game, the goal is to merge cells with identical numbers until you reach the number 2048. The cells can only contain integer values that are powers of two, starting from 2, such as 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on.

The board is a 4 x 4 grid, holding up to 16 cells. If the grid fills up and no further moves, like merging cells, are possible, the game ends.
